## Concept
Cesar and Ballsack go on adventure to bake the perfect birthday cake.

### Level Ideas
They must find three ingredients:
* Eggs -- steal it from a chicken
	- chickens lay explosive eggs -- bomber
* Milk -- steal it from a cow
	- cows like to tip over and lay on you -- melee
* Sugar -- steal it from the candy kingdom
	- sugar gremlins -- ranged and melee

### Hub Ideas
One large map with one central hub:
* the bakery/farm
* descend into farm caverns -- this gives me an excuse not to draw backgrounds
