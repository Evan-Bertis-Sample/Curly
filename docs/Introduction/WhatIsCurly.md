# What is Curly?

Curly is a lightweight unity framework that promotes solid architecture, and removes the redundancy of implementing systems found in almost all games.

Too often do Unity projects devolve into a architectural mess. Developers of all experience fail to think about how they are structuring their systems, or even overcomplicate their architecture. Curly provides a set of prebuilt systems, file structure, and flexible utilities to help allieviate this.

Curly comes prebuilt with a:
* Configurable App and Bootstrap system
* Scene Management, Audio Management, and Input Management systems
* A highly configuratble save and load system
* A custom logger that makes debugging a breeze
* A light-weight dependency injection framework
* Useful property drawers, custom editors, and more!
* Unity-specific and general C# utiliites
* A scalable file architecture that makes use of assembly definitions for fast domain reloads
* And so much more...

Curly promises to help developers get past the initial barrier of backend developmenent, and get them straight into developing their dream game.
