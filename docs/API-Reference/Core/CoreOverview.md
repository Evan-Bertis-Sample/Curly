# Curly Core Overview

The ```CurlyCore``` namespace contains all core systems to most games, including:

* App Management Systems - ```CurlyCore.CurlyApp```
* Audio Management Systems - ```CurlyCore.Audio```
* Input Management Systems - ```CurlyCore.Input```
* Saving and Loading Systems - ```CurlyCore.Saving```
* Custom Logging Systems - ```CurlyCore.Debugging```
* Scene Management Systems - ```CurlyCore.SceneManagement```

These core systems comprise the base layer for most games. These core systems live in their own Assembly Definition, which improves compilation times.

The source code for these systems can be found under ```Assets/Code/Core```.
